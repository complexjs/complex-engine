# ComplexJS

ComplexJS is a JS written Component Entity System for HTML5 Gamedevelopment.

It's strong structure enforces you to write seperated code in a very reusable way. This means that you can reuse the components
already created in other projects and add them to a new one.

## Concept
ComplexJS is a Component Entity System Framework. This means it provides you the functionality to build something bigger. It comes
with a lot of extensions already. Those can be found [here](https://github.com/complexjs).

If there is no extension that works for you, you can easily create your own. Check out the `Module` section of this documentation
