# ComplexJS

ComplexJS is a JS written Component Entity System for HTML5 Gamedevelopment.

ComplexJS has the ability not to minimize your development time.
With it's Component Entity System there is a high rate of reusable code for your later projects.

## Concept
ComplexJS is a Component Entity System Framework. This means it provides you the functionality to build something bigger. It comes
with a lot of extensions already. Those can be found [here](https://github.com/complexjs).

If there is no extension that works for you, you can easily create your own. Check out the `Module` section of this documentation
